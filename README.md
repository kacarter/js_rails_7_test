# Rails 7 JavaScript/jQuery Demo App

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

This demo app shows how to get JavaScript to run on the initial visit to a page while keeping Turbo on. This is
accomplished by using a Stimulus controller's connect method. This app also includes using jQuery, since many gems still
require that.

* Ruby version: 3.1.3
